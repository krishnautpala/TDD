# TDD on fibnocci
While coding for fibnocci using TDD, I started writing the test document first that and then created the required function in the main program.
It has been easy for the program structure because I knew what I pass as input and output before starting the function.
I used to follow similar approach earlier before but the other way around. I used to write function and then write a test case for it.
But doing other way around, made me think about possible scenarios before even starting code.
I will try implementing this on at my work.

Write a brief, informal summary of your experience with TDD. What are your impressions of TDD? Do you like the approach? Do you dislike it? What issues did you find with using TDD. Would you use TDD in your development workflow?
