# Tic Tac Toe game

First I started with creating TTT_test.py where I have all the unit test cases for all the functions required for tic tac toe game
Then I created TTT.py which has all the function definitions and ran the test cases created from TTT_test.py.
But I reliazed that a driver program is necessay is run and test the complete prgoram and created TTT_main.py which is the driver program
for playing tic tac toe. But I has difficultly in understanding how to create test cases for TTT_main.py since it a driver program and it is which
is a little testing the end to end flow. I didn't understood whether main program itself a test case or can it have some other test cases.
